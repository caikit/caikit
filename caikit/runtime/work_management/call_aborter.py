    This class registers a callback with a grpc context, to be called in the event of rpc
    termination. Termination could be nominal (we returned a response) but we should have
    relinquished control anyway. The interesting case is when a client cancels a call or a deadline
    is hit, which could trigger this callback but will not interrupt the thread doing work.

    In order to actually interrupt threads doing the work, events can be registered with an
    instance of this class in order ton receive notification on RPC termination.

    IFF the RPC has been terminated, `must_abort` will return True.
