class AbortableAction:
    """A class for Abortable Actions. We want actions that are computationally heavy to be
    abortable by Model Mesh! Currently, we use this for the following operations.

    - Loading a model
    - Predicting with a model
    - Training a model

    In the future, this may include getting the size of a model, depending on how that we choose
    to implement that.

    How it works:
        Instances of this class create a threading.Event, which will be used to signal that either:
        - The RPC was terminated
        - The heavy work that we wanted to complete is done
        This is done by using a RpcAborter and a DestroyableThread.
        Registering the event with the RpcAborter will cause it to set when the RPC is
        terminated, and creating a DestroyableThread with the event will cause it to set when
        the thread terminates.

        The action will start the DestroyableThread and then wait on the event. When it wakes, it
        will check the reason and destroy the thread if it was woken by the RpcAborter or return
        the result if it was woken by the thread completing.
